# Car Purchase Prediction Using ML

## Team ID: Team-592817

### Team Members:
- Hemant Modi
- Immidi Shreyas

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting car purchases using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Leveraging demographic data such as age, gender, and income, the model aims to forecast the likelihood of a customer purchasing a car. The predictive insights gained from this model assist car dealerships in targeting potential buyers more effectively, optimizing their marketing strategies.

## Deployed Website:
